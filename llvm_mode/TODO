TODO for alf-llvm-lto-instrumentation:
* at the first bb of a function get the callsites and their loc_id
* start with the analysis in main or _init if present, keep track which
  functions have been done
* be more intelligent with which bb to instrument (more work to find
  predecessors with loc_id though)
* better algo for putting stuff in the map?

TODO for Makefile
* test if /bin/ld is hardcoded into clang and warn users if so (ld --afl test)

??? Issues
* What to do with hardcoded /bin/ld
* What to do with ld to libraries (added to .a etc.)
