TODO for afl-llvm-lto-instrumentation:
* at the first bb of a function get the callsites and their loc_id
* start with the analysis in main or _init if present, keep track which
  functions have been done
* be more intelligent with which bb to instrument (more work to find
  predecessors with loc_id though)
* better algo for putting stuff in the map?

TODO for afl-llvm-lto-whitelist
* different solution then renaming?

Issues
* What to do with ld to libraries (added to .a etc.)
